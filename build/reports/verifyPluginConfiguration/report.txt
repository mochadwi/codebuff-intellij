- The Java configuration specifies sourceCompatibility='17' but IntelliJ Platform '2024.2' requires sourceCompatibility='21'.
- The dependency on the Kotlin Standard Library (stdlib) is automatically added when using the Gradle Kotlin plugin and may conflict with the version provided with the IntelliJ Platform, see: https://jb.gg/intellij-platform-kotlin-stdlib
- The Kotlin Coroutines library must not be added explicitly to the project as it is already provided with the IntelliJ Platform, see: https://jb.gg/intellij-platform-kotlin-coroutines
